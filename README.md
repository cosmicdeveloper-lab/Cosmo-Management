# 🛍️ Smart Clothing Shop Management System

This Django project provides an intelligent management system for a clothing retail business operating **online and offline**, with **multiple branches** across a city.  
It predicts **workforce balancing** (between sellers and admins), **inventory distribution**, and **product transfer suggestions** based on real sales, website views, street crowd levels, seasonal events, and fashion trends.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 **Workforce Prediction**: Suggests when to move sellers to admins (and vice-versa) based on online vs offline sales ratios.
- 📦 **Inventory Distribution**: Predicts how much of each product should be stocked at each branch and online warehouse.
- 🔄 **Product Transfer Suggestions**: Advises shifting products from low-demand to high-demand branches dynamically.
- 🧠 **Admin Dashboard**: Clean Bootstrap 5 UI showing predictions, inventory, and transfers.
- ⚙️ **Dummy Data Generator**: Populate the database with realistic fake data for testing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django 4.x (Python 3.9+)
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5 (pure HTML/CSS/JS)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / SQLite (for development)
